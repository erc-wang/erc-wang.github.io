    <h1>Project 1</h1>
    <h3>Imports</h3>
    <code>
        <pre>
        import numpy as np
        import skimage as sk
        import skimage.io as skio
        import scipy
        from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
        </pre>
    </code>
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>The start of the project followed the skeleton provided in the colorized_skel.py file. We separate the channels just as the skeleton shows.</p>
    <p>Crop helper function that find first corner value that is no longer either entirely black or white. We use a rudimentary method of checking the corners until we find a value that starkly contrasts the rest of the photo.</p>
    <p>I utilize Normalize Cross-Correlation to find alignment</p>
    <p>There is commented code for edges that was attempted that creates similar images for the jpgs, but fails to run in a timely manner for tifs. </p>
    <p>For aligning, I used ncc to score positions within the images that shared the highest score values.</p>
    <p>As exhaustive search is inefficient and too slow for larger sized images, we use an image pyramid to align the larger images</p>
    <p>Attempt to create canny edge detector image mask to use edges to score images instead of pixel color</p>
    <p>Sample Canny Edge Result</p>

    <p>Some of the result images especially ones where there are more artifacts as a result of the cropping for channels, do not have the greatest alignment but can be remedied by proper edge scoring. I was not able to try a variety of edge options, however I saw many sublisted on the wikipedia page for Canny Edge Detecting and I am sure that one of them would be viable and more efficient.</p>
