    <h1>Project 2: Fun with Filters and Frequencies!</h1>
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>This project shows various ways to manipulate frequencies to exhibit interesting visual effects. The project will cover image sharpening, blurring, hybrid images and blends.</p>
    <h3>Finite Difference Operator</h3>
    <img src="pictures/cameraman.png" width="500" height="500">
    <p>Using the provided finite difference operators we can achieve the D_x and D_y variants of the image through convolution</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <img src="output/cameraman_dx.png" width="400" height="500">
                <p>Dx</p>
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="output/cameraman_dy.png" width="500" height="500">
                <p>Dx</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>We can also find the magnitude through the previous two images, as well as find the edge image through binarization</p>
    <p>Some of the result images especially ones where there are more artifacts as a result of the cropping for channels, do not have the greatest alignment but can be remedied by proper edge scoring. I was not able to try a variety of edge options, however I saw many sublisted on the wikipedia page for Canny Edge Detecting and I am sure that one of them would be viable and more efficient.</p>
